                        <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern software engineering is getting increasingly complicated.  Especially in the HPC field, we are dealing with cutting edge infrastructure and a novel problem with unprecedented scale. The ability to monitor and analyze the performance of such applications and infrastructure is imperative for the future of improvement, design, and maintenance. In the current era, the writing and maintenance of these applications have ceased to be the job solely of computer scientists and have grown to encompass a wide variety of experts in mathematics, science, and other engineering disciplines. The fact that many developers from these disciplines have not received a formal education in computer science and rely increasingly on the tools created by computer scientists to analyze and optimize their code shows that there's a need for a forum to work together.

                        <p>The Workshop on Performance EngineeRing, Modelling, Analysis, and VisualizatiOn STrategy (PERMAVOST)
                             goal is to bridge tools developers and end users of performance analysis tools. It is a half day 
                             workshop with a keynote in conjunction with HPDC 2025. We are hoping that the stakeholders, which 
                             are application developers, domain scientists, analyst, and tools developers can collaborate and 
                             build a bridge to fill in the gaps in various topics such as:</p>
                        <ul>
			    <li><b>Key metrics, patterns, and performance pitfalls</b>: Identifying strategies to recognize and leverage performance insights to enhance application efficiency.</li>
			    <li><b>Emerging challenges</b>: Addressing issues arising from new computing architectures, programming paradigms, novel scientific problems, and the processing of data at varying scales.</li>

			<p>With the exponential growth of big data and AI, computing has become data-centric, making data management the top priority in computing systems. Traditional I/O and storage paradigms no longer meet the demands of data-centric computing. A paradigm shift is necessary to seamlessly integrate high-performance computing power with the velocity, volume, and variety of data to serve diverse AI needs. This keynote explores the critical challenges and introduces a new paradigm, named Dataflow under the von Neumann machine (DataflowV). We first present the Concurrent-AMAT (C-AMAT) model, which quantifies the benefits of concurrent data access and reveals the relationship between data locality and concurrency. Next, we introduce the Layer Performance Matching (LPM) framework to optimize memory system performance and formally introduce the concept of DataflowV. We then share some of our recent practices and successes with the DataflowV paradigm, including the Hermes multi-tiered I/O buffering system and others. Finally, we discuss fundamental issues of performance modeling and data-centric rethinking. The C-AMAT model provides a way to bridge the performance gap at each layer of the memory hierarchy. The LPM framework offers a methodology to optimize a memory system through smart layer optimization. They are powerful, but many fundamental questions remain open. Have we fully utilized modern hardware advances to reach their full potential? Should advanced memory systems be built under a “concurrent-aware locality” model? etc.?</p>

			<p><strong style="color: #222;">"Towards a Workflow for Analytic Performance, Power, and Energy Models"</strong></p>
			<p>White- and gray-box performance models are invaluable for assessing
resource and scalability bottlenecks in parallel programs. More often
than not, authors of simulation software have no idea about the
interactions of their software with the hardware, let alone its power
and energy consumption behavior. Analytic, predictive white-box models
such as Roofline are tremendously helpful for exposing relevant
bottlenecks, but they are tedious to set up because hardly any tool
support exists. I will give an overview of different modeling
approaches, ranging from black-box (curve-fitting, machine learning)
approaches to fully analytic models based on first principles. This
large spectrum of possibilities bears some potential for automation,
even if we restrict ourselves to white-box variants. I will point out
what we already have and what is still missing in this area. Finally,
I will give an overview of interesting dynamic application behavior
that can get in the way of predictive modeling.</p>

He received the “2011 Informatics Europe Curriculum Best Practices Award” (together with Jan Treibig and Gerhard Wellein) for outstanding contributions to teaching in computer science. His textbook “Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers” is recommended or required reading in many HPC-related lectures and courses worldwide. Together with colleagues from FAU, HLRS Stuttgart, and TU Wien he develops and conducts successful international tutorials on node-level performance engineering and hybrid programming.</p>

											<p><strong style="color: #222;">"Holistic performance engineering and analysis: from UX until low level performance data"</strong></p>
                    	<p>This panel brings together a diverse team of three experts to explore the key challenges in achieving comprehensive performance engineering and analysis. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) continues to become more mainstream, the need for a holistic approach is increasingly critical. The panel will delve into whether such an approach is becoming more important, how different stakeholders (from UX designers to low-level engineers) perceive performance, and the varying perspectives across different institutions.

The session will feature a dynamic Q&A format, led by the moderator, encouraging deep discussion and direct interaction with the audience. Participants will have the opportunity to engage with the experts, ask questions, and contribute to the conversation, making this an interactive and collaborative exploration of the future of performance engineering.</p>
