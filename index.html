                        <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern software engineering is getting increasingly complicated.  Especially in the HPC field, we are dealing with cutting edge infrastructure and a novel problem with unprecedented scale. The ability to monitor and analyze the performance of such applications and infrastructure is imperative for the future of improvement, design, and maintenance. In the current era, the writing and maintenance of these applications have ceased to be the job solely of computer scientists and has grown to encompass a wide variety of experts in mathematics, science, and other engineering disciplines. The fact that many developers from these disciplines have not received a formal education in computer science and rely increasingly on the tools created by computer scientists to analyze and optimize their code shows that there's a need for a forum to work together.

                    	<p>In most scientific domains, results are now obtained thanks to computational science that heavily relies on numerical simulations. This in turn leads to a tremendous increase in size and complexity of the underlying computing infrastructures. The performance assessment of such distributed systems and the applications they run is then a complex task for which various approaches can be considered. This talk will give a general overview of these approaches for the performance assessment of distributed systems and applications: experimentation, emulation, and simulation. It will specifically focus on the main features and strengths of the SimGrid toolkit. SimGrid is a 20+ year old research project whose scope has broaden over the years from the simulation of computing grids to P2P systems, clouds, and HPC. It will introduce the two main programming APIs, the underlying (in)validated models, and present some of the tools based on SimGrid that are currently available.</p>
						<p>Frederic Suter is a Senior Research Scientist in the Workflow Systems Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory since February 2022.

											<p><strong style="color: #222;">"Integrating Visualization (and Visualization Experts) with Performance Analysis"</strong></p>
											<p>Identifying and understanding poor performance is an increasingly difficult task due to the growing complexity and scale of target applications and systems. Visualization is an important tool for exploratory and comprehension-centered goals, leading to development of visualizations and visual tools from both the performance analysis and visualization communities. However, there are several obstacles to wide-spread adoption of these visual tools and techniques, such as scale and ease-of-use. Furthermore, the challenge of visualizing such large and complex data often takes precedence over the other challenges that must be solved to get these tools into the hands of users. Addressing these issues requires making trade-offs which in turn require a firm understanding of performance analysts’ needs and workflows. Through several projects in performance visualization, I discuss observed barriers to designing and deploying performance visualization solutions as well as the perspective of visualization-focused experts in working in the performance analysis space. I then propose directions focusing on these gaps between the visual design and integration into performance analysis workflows.</p>
											<p>Kate Isaacs is an assistant professor at the University of Arizona. Her interests include data visualization and high performance computing. She focuses on visualization challenges in complex exploratory analysis scenarios such as those of active research teams. These challenges include representational and interactive scalability concerns for networks and timelines, integrating interactive visualizations in scripting workflows, and improving visualization methodologies for such projects. Kate has collaborated with researchers in high performance computing, distributed computing, data science, program analysis, optimization, and environmental planning. Her work is supported by the NSF and DOE, including an NSF CRII award in 2017, an NSF CAREER award in 2019, and a DOE Early Career Research Program award in 2021.</p>
