                        <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern software engineering is getting increasingly complicated.  Especially in the HPC field, we are dealing with cutting edge infrastructure and a novel problem with unprecedented scale. The ability to monitor and analyze the performance of such applications and infrastructure is imperative for the future of improvement, design, and maintenance. In the current era, the writing and maintenance of these applications have ceased to be the job solely of computer scientists and have grown to encompass a wide variety of experts in mathematics, science, and other engineering disciplines. The fact that many developers from these disciplines have not received a formal education in computer science and rely increasingly on the tools created by computer scientists to analyze and optimize their code shows that there's a need for a forum to work together.

                        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
                        <p>The Workshop on Performance EngineeRing, Modelling, Analysis, and VisualizatiOn STrategy (PERMAVOST)
                             goal is to bridge tools developers and end users of performance analysis tools. It is a half day 
                             workshop with a keynote in conjunction with HPDC 2025. We are hoping that the stakeholders, which 
                             are application developers, domain scientists, analyst, and tools developers can collaborate and 
                             build a bridge to fill in the gaps in various topics such as:</p>
                        <ul>
			    <li><b>Key metrics, patterns, and performance pitfalls</b>: Identifying strategies to recognize and leverage performance insights to enhance application efficiency.</li>
			    <li><b>Emerging challenges</b>: Addressing issues arising from new computing architectures, programming paradigms, novel scientific problems, and the processing of data at varying scales.</li>
			    <li><b>Usability in performance tools</b>: Exploring how modern usability design principles can be integrated into performance analysis tools to better support their users.</li>
			    <li><b>Broad-spectrum accessibility</b>: Developing analysis methods and methodologies that cater to users with varying levels of HPC expertise.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This talk will focus on challenges and opportunities in designing converged middleware for HPC, AI (Deep/Machine Learning), Big Data, and Data Science. We will start with the challenges in designing runtime environments for MPI+X programming models by considering support for multi-core systems, high-performance networks (InfiniBand, RoCE, Slingshot), GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel), and emerging BlueField-3 DPUs. Features and sample performance numbers of using the MVAPICH2 libraries over a range of benchmarks will be presented. Performance engineering of HPC applications with TAU and INAM profiling software will be highlighted. For the Deep/Machine Learning domain, we will focus on MPI-driven solutions (MPI4DL) and Mix-and-match Communication Runtime (MCR-DL) to extract performance and scalability for popular Deep Learning frameworks (TensorFlow and PyTorch), large out-of-core models, Bluefield-3 DPUs, and parallel inferencing. Performance engineering of Deep Learning Training applications with a novel Deep Introspection framework will be highlighted. Finally, we will focus on MPI-driven solutions to accelerate Big Data applications (MPI4Spark) and data science applications (MPI4Dask) with appropriate benchmark results will be presented.</p>

			<p>The JUPITER Research and Early Access Program (JUREAP) will support early applications on JUPITER to utilize the machine most efficiently. We are building up and extending on experiences with previous systems at JSC to implement a holistic program. JUREAP will target collaboration with about 20 applications on JUPITER that are balanced in terms of methods (including AI) and scientific domains. JSC experts and application scientists will support optimization of use-cases to enable highly efficient execution and push the boundaries of high-performance computing (HPC) beyond the state of the art. JUREAP will not only enable full-scale runs, but also support their execution, analysis, and joint publications. This talk summarizes the current developments and plans in the context of JUREAP. It will also provide a general overview of JUPITER.
