                    <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                    Modern software engineering is getting increasingly complicated.  Especially in the HPC field, we are dealing with cutting edge infrastructure and a novel problem with unprecedented scale. The ability to monitor and analyze the performance of such applications and infrastructure is imperative for the future of improvement, design, and maintenance. In the current era, the writing and maintenance of these applications have ceased to be the job solely of computer scientists and have grown to encompass a wide variety of experts in mathematics, science, and other engineering disciplines. The fact that many developers from these disciplines have not received a formal education in computer science and rely increasingly on the tools created by computer scientists to analyze and optimize their code shows that there's a need for a forum to work together.

                    <p>The Workshop on Performance EngineeRing, Modelling, Analysis, and VisualizatiOn STrategy (PERMAVOST)
                    goal is to bridge tools developers and end users of performance analysis tools. It is a half day 
                    workshop with a keynote in conjunction with HPDC 2026. We are hoping that the stakeholders, which 
                    are application developers, domain scientists, analyst, and tools developers can collaborate and 
                    build a bridge to fill in the gaps in various topics such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Key metrics, patterns, and performance pitfalls</b>: Identifying strategies to recognize and leverage performance insights to enhance application efficiency.</li>
                        <li><b>Emerging challenges</b>: Addressing issues arising from new computing architectures, programming paradigms, novel scientific problems, and the processing of data at varying scales.</li>
                        <li><b>Usability in performance tools</b>: Exploring how modern usability design principles can be integrated into performance analysis tools to better support their users.</li>
                        <li><b>Broad-spectrum accessibility</b>: Developing analysis methods and methodologies that cater to users with varying levels of HPC expertise.</li>

                    <!--     <p>With the exponential growth of big data and AI, computing has become data-centric, making data management the top priority in computing systems. Traditional I/O and storage paradigms no longer meet the demands of data-centric computing. A paradigm shift is necessary to seamlessly integrate high-performance computing power with the velocity, volume, and variety of data to serve diverse AI needs. This keynote explores the critical challenges and introduces a new paradigm, named Dataflow under the von Neumann machine (DataflowV). We first present the Concurrent-AMAT (C-AMAT) model, which quantifies the benefits of concurrent data access and reveals the relationship between data locality and concurrency. Next, we introduce the Layer Performance Matching (LPM) framework to optimize memory system performance and formally introduce the concept of DataflowV. We then share some of our recent practices and successes with the DataflowV paradigm, including the Hermes multi-tiered I/O buffering system and others. Finally, we discuss fundamental issues of performance modeling and data-centric rethinking. The C-AMAT model provides a way to bridge the performance gap at each layer of the memory hierarchy. The LPM framework offers a methodology to optimize a memory system through smart layer optimization. They are powerful, but many fundamental questions remain open. Have we fully utilized modern hardware advances to reach their full potential? Should advanced memory systems be built under a “concurrent-aware locality” model? etc.?</p>  -->
