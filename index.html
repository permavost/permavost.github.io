                        <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern software engineering is getting increasingly complicated.  Especially in the HPC field, we are dealing with cutting edge infrastructure and a novel problem with unprecedented scale. The ability to monitor and analyze the performance of such applications and infrastructure is imperative for the future of improvement, design, and maintenance. In the current era, the writing and maintenance of these applications have ceased to be the job solely of computer scientists and have grown to encompass a wide variety of experts in mathematics, science, and other engineering disciplines. The fact that many developers from these disciplines have not received a formal education in computer science and rely increasingly on the tools created by computer scientists to analyze and optimize their code shows that there's a need for a forum to work together.

			    <p>Python has become the de-facto language for scientific computing. Programming in Python is highly productive, mainly due to its rich science-oriented software ecosystem built around the NumPy module. As a result, the demand for Python support in High Performance Computing (HPC) has skyrocketed. However, the Python language itself does not necessarily offer high performance. In this work, we present Data-Centric Python (DaCe.Python) that retains Python's high productivity while achieving portable performance across different architectures. The workflow's key features are HPC-oriented language extensions and a set of automatic optimizations powered by a data-centric intermediate representation. We also define a set of around 50 benchmark kernels written in NumPy to evaluate and compare Python frameworks for their portability and performance. We show performance results and scaling across CPU, GPU, FPGA, with 2.47x and 3.75x speedups over previous-best solutions and the first-ever Xilinx and Intel FPGA results of annotated Python.</p>

											<p>Scientific software used on high performance computing (HPC) platforms is in a phase of transformation because of combined increase in the heterogeneity and complexity of models and hardware platforms. Having separate implementations for different platforms is not an option, therefore, computational science community has been looking for mechanisms to express code through abstractions that can be specialized for different platforms. Some approaches have met success through the use of template meta-programming in C++. However, their reliance upon C++ makes these approaches inaccessible to the non C++ codes. In this presentation, we describe a methodology and a set of tools for performance portability that we are developing for applications in any language. The tools also provide mechanism for mapping computation to different devices on a node, and a mechanism for orchestrating the data movement.</p>

											<p><strong style="color: #222;">"Hey CAI - Conversational AI Enabled User Interface for HPC Tools"</strong></p>
											<p>HPC system users depend on profiling and analysis tools to obtain insights into the performance of their applications and tweak them. The complexity of modern HPC systems have necessitated advances in the associated HPC tools making them equally complex with various advanced features and complex user interfaces. While these interfaces are extensive and detailed, they require a steep learning curve even for expert users making them harder to use for novice users. While users are intuitively able to express what they are looking for in words or text (e.g., show me the process transmitting maximum data), they find it hard to quickly adapt to, navigate, and use the interface of advanced HPC tools to obtain desired insights. In this talk, we present the challenges associated with designing a conversational (speech/text) interface for HPC tools. We use state-of-the-art AI models for speech and text and adapt it for use in the HPC arena by retraining them on a new HPC dataset we create. We demonstrate that our proposed model, retrained with an HPC specific dataset, can deliver higher accuracy than the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained language models. We also create an interface to convert speech/text data to commands for HPC tools and show how users can utilize the proposed interface to gain insights quicker leading to better productivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort aimed at designing a conversational interface for HPC tools using state-of-the-art AI techniques to enhance the productivity of novice and advanced users alike.</p>
